The Django MVT architecture was implemented with clear separation of concerns:

```python
# Example: Product Model with Brand Support
class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    brand = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    stock_count = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    is_featured = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

**Key Architectural Benefits**:
- **Scalability**: Each component can be scaled independently
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns simplifies debugging and updates
- **Testability**: Modular design enables comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing functionality

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["gunicorn", "ipswich_retail.wsgi:application"]
```

**Frontend Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 3000
```

#### 2.3.2 Docker Compose Orchestration

The development environment was orchestrated using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/ipswich_retail
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
  
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
  
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
