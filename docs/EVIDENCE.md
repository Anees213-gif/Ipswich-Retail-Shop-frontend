## What Went Well / What Went Wrong / Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- [ ] Docker containerization worked smoothly
- [ ] API contract fixes resolved frontend/backend mismatches
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup was straightforward
- [ ] Testing infrastructure provided good coverage
- [ ] Documentation was comprehensive and helpful
- [ ] Free-tier deployment was successful

### What Went Wrong
- [ ] Initial API contract mismatches caused integration issues
- [ ] Missing test coverage required significant effort to implement
- [ ] Environment variable configuration was more complex than expected
- [ ] Docker build times were longer than anticipated
- [ ] Some third-party service integrations had limitations

### Lessons Learned
- [ ] API contracts should be defined upfront with proper testing
- [ ] Test-driven development would have caught issues earlier
- [ ] Environment configuration should be standardized from the start
- [ ] Documentation should be maintained throughout development
- [ ] Free-tier services have limitations that need to be considered
- [ ] Security hardening should be implemented incrementally
- [ ] Monitoring and observability are crucial for production readiness

## Reflection Notes

### Technical Insights
- The Django REST Framework provides excellent API capabilities but requires careful configuration for production use
- React with TypeScript provides excellent type safety but requires consistent API contracts
- Docker containerization significantly improves development and deployment consistency
- CI/CD pipelines are essential for maintaining code quality and deployment reliability

### Process Improvements
- Implement API contract testing earlier in the development process
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of new functionality
- Establish clear coding standards and review processes
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting from day one

### Future Considerations
- Consider implementing microservices architecture for scalability
- Add advanced caching strategies for improved performance
- Implement comprehensive user analytics and business intelligence
- Consider adding mobile app support
- Plan for internationalization and multi-currency support
