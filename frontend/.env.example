# API Configuration
# Set this to your Django backend URL when ready
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

# When VITE_API_URL is not set, the app will use mock data for development
# This allows you to develop the frontend before the backend is ready

# Other environment variables can be added here as needed
# VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id
# VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your-stripe-public-keycls'c;s
